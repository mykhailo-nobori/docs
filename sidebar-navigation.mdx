# Sidebar Navigation

The left sidebar in Nobori.ai is organized by **Track → Measure → Act**.  
Use the global filters at the top (Tags, Country, Date range, Platforms) to scope every view.

---

## Global Filters

- **Tags** – (optional) group prompts; filter any view by tag.  
- **Country** – run and read results per market (e.g., United States, Germany).  
- **Date range** – compare recent runs (7, 30 days, custom).  
- **Platforms** – limit to specific AI models when needed.

<Note>
Filters apply to Dashboard, Prompts, Competitors, and Citations.

## Track

### Dashboard
High-level view of visibility performance.
- **Visibility Score** – % of prompts where your brand appears in AI answers (over time).
- **Competitors** – rank table by Visibility.
- **Cited Domains** – which domains AI models rely on to answer your prompts.

### Prompts
Manage and analyze the questions Nobori.ai runs across AI models.
- Tabs: **Active**, **Suggested**, **Inactive**.
- Actions: **Add Prompt**, **Export**, bulk **Activate/Deactivate/Delete**.
- **Prompt Details** → time-series visibility, competitor table, and two tabs:
  - **Executions** – list of AI answers (status, platform, response, mentions).
  - **Citations** – URLs used by AI with columns: *Used*, *Platforms*, *Type* (Publisher/Owned/Competitor/Community/Other), *Mentions*, *Mentioned*.

### Competitors
Add and manage brands you benchmark against.
- Compare Visibility Score and rank per prompt/time window.
- Used across Dashboard and Prompt Details.

## Measure

### Citations
Everything AI models cite to answer your prompts.
- Tabs: **Cited Pages** (URL-level), **Cited Domains** (domain-level).
- Columns include *Used %/count*, *Platforms*, *Type*, *Mentions*, *Mentioned*.
- Use this to find publishers to contact and owned pages to strengthen.

<Note>
“Mentions” here indicates whether the AI answer named the brand; “Citations” indicate which sources the model relied on — they are not the same.
</Note>

## Act

### Get Cited
Operational workspace for outreach.
- **Contact Publishers** – weekly refreshed list of AI-cited pages missing your brand.
- Actions: **Draft Email**, status pipeline (**Needs Attention → In Progress → Completed → Canceled**).
