description: What each section in Nobori.ai does — Track, Measure, Act, and Workspace — plus how global filters affect your views.
---

Nobori.ai is organized as **Track → Measure → Act**, with workspace settings and billing separated under **Workspace**.

Many pages share the same top-bar controls (like **Platforms** and **Date range**), so you can quickly scope what you’re looking at.

## Global filters

These appear in the top bar on most analytics pages.

- **Platforms** — choose where to measure visibility (e.g., ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity).  
- **Date range** — common presets like *Last 7 days / Last 30 days / Last 3 months*.  
- **Country** — shown on Prompt-related views when results depend on location (because prompts run from a selected country).  
- **Notifications** — currently a placeholder (coming soon).

<Note>
Not every page has every filter. Prompts and Prompt Details are the most country-dependent views.

Everything AI models cite or rely on to answer your tracked prompts.

Tabs:
