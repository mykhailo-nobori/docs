The Dashboard is the fastest way to answer three questions:

1. How visible is my brand across AI platforms?
2. Which competitors show up instead of me — and how strongly?
3. Which domains AI platforms cite to answer my prompts?

## Filters

Use the top-right filters to scope the entire Dashboard.

| Filter | What it changes |
|---|---|
| **All platforms** | Limits data to selected AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, AI Overviews, Perplexity). |
| **Time range** | Controls the reporting window (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, last 3 months). |
| **Notifications** | Coming soon. |

<Note>
Filters apply to the Visibility Score chart, Competitors table, and Cited Domains table.

## Visibility Score

The **Visibility Score** shows the percentage of prompts where your brand appears in AI-generated answers.

- Higher is better.
- Use it to track progress over time after changes to prompts, content, or outreach.

### Competitors toggle

Enable the **Competitors** toggle to overlay tracked competitors on the same chart.

This helps you see:

- whether you're gaining visibility relative to others
- which competitor consistently dominates across the time window

## Competitors widget

The **Competitors** table compares active competitors using:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Position** | Average ranking position in AI answers (lower is better). |
| **Visibility** | % of prompts where the competitor appears. |

Use **Show all** to open the full competitors view.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Competitors" href="/competitors">
    Manage active competitors and review AI-suggested ones.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Cited Domains widget

The **Cited Domains** table lists domains AI platforms cite to answer your prompts.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Used** | How often the domain appears as a cited source within the selected scope. |

This is the most direct signal of what sources AI platforms *trust* for your topic.

Use **Show all** to open the full citations view.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Citations" href="/citations">
    Drill into cited pages and domains, and find citation gaps.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
