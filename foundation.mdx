# Foundation

Foundation is your baseline to get cited. It runs a lightweight audit of your website and generates actionable tasks when something blocks AI systems from finding, understanding, or confidently citing your content.

## What Foundation checks

At the top of the page you’ll see three technical checks:

- **Robots.txt** — verifies crawlers aren’t unintentionally blocked from important pages.
- **Sitemap** — verifies a sitemap is present and usable for discovery.
- **Crawlability** — verifies key pages can be fetched and navigated reliably.

Each check shows a status:
- **Good** (green): looks fine.
- If a check fails: Foundation will create tasks to help you fix what’s blocking discovery/citation.

<Note>
Foundation refreshes on a schedule (you’ll see the next run time at the top). Results update automatically after each run.
</Note>

## Tasks and the Kanban board

Below the checks is a board that turns findings into work you can track.

### Board columns

- **To do** — new tasks that need attention.
- **In progress** — tasks you’re actively working on.
- **Completed** — finished tasks.
- **Dismissed** — tasks you intentionally won’t do (for now).

### Filters

Use the filters at the top to focus your view:
- **Type**
- **Priority**
- **Effort**
- **Date range**

You can also use **Search** to find tasks quickly.

## The two Foundation task types

When Foundation generates tasks, it focuses on two high-impact areas:

### 1) Facts-rich company description

A consistent, specific description across your website and public profiles helps AI systems understand:
- what you do
- who you serve
- how to describe you accurately

This improves the odds that AI answers mention your brand correctly and confidently.

### 2) Commercial pages for buyer evaluation

AI systems often cite pages that look like “decision pages” — clear pages that help a buyer evaluate:
- what you offer
- use cases / solutions
- pricing or packaging signals (even without exact numbers)
- comparisons and alternatives (when relevant)
- proof and outcomes (case studies, examples)

This task typically includes a suggested set of pages to build or upgrade, plus why each page matters.

<Note>
Foundation tasks are designed to be practical. They focus on clear improvements that make your site easier to retrieve, easier to interpret, and easier to cite.

## Task details

Open any task card to see:

- **Status** — move the task across To do → In progress → Completed (or Dismissed).
- **Priority** — High / Medium / Low.
- **Effort** — Low / Medium / High.
- **Description** — the rationale and what to change.
- **Impact** — what improving this is expected to unlock (visibility, citations, conversion).
- **Subtasks** — a checklist of concrete deliverables (often with suggested pages).

### Subtasks

Subtasks are meant to be execution-ready:
- check them off as you complete them
- use them to delegate work across content, SEO, and engineering

## Recommended workflow

1. Start with any **failed check** (Robots/Sitemap/Crawlability) — unblock discovery first.
2. Then complete the **company description** task — align messaging across key pages.
3. Then work through the **commercial pages** task — add/upgrade decision pages.
4. Keep tasks updated as you work so the board stays reliable.
