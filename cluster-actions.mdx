title: Cluster Actions
description: Turn “Boost” results into a prioritized action board (outreach, community, guest posts) based on what AI systems cite today.
---

Cluster Actions is where Nobori.ai converts your **Boosted Prompts** into a practical execution plan.

When you Boost a cluster in **Prompts**, we analyze:
- what sources AI systems are citing for those prompts today
- where your brand is missing
- what actions would most likely increase your chance to be **mentioned and cited** for the same buyer-intent questions

<Note>
Cluster Actions are created from **Boost** on the Prompts page. If you haven’t boosted a cluster yet, start in <a href="/prompts">Prompts</a>.

## What you’ll see

### Cluster selector
On the left, choose **All Clusters** or a specific cluster (e.g., “Custom Software Development”).  
Actions are scoped to the selected cluster.

### Filters
At the top you can filter by:
- **Type** (action type)
- **Priority**
- **Effort**
- **Platforms** (where the prompt runs / is tracked)

### Board columns
Same workflow as Foundation:

- **To do**
- **In Progress**
- **Completed**
- **Dismissed**

## What “Boost Prompts” means

Each action is tied to the **Boost Prompts** you selected (the buyer-intent questions you want to win).  
We show those prompts inside the action so you always know what the work is meant to improve.

Typical Boost prompts look like:
- “Best [category] tools”
- “Shortlist vendors for [use case]”
- “Compare providers for [requirements]”
- “RFP / proposal guidance for [category]”

## Action types

Below are the most common action types you’ll see. Your workspace may not include all of them yet.

### Outreach
**Goal:** get added to pages that already rank and get cited (listicles, directories, high-authority publisher pages).

What it usually includes:
- a clear “exact ask” (what to request from the publisher/editor)
- proof points to prepare (only verifiable items)
- paste-ready snippets you can adapt
- a list of target pages under **Evidence**

**Success looks like:** your brand appears on existing high-visibility pages that AI systems already retrieve for the cluster.

---

### Community
**Goal:** earn crawlable mentions in high-ranking community threads (e.g., Reddit, DEV, LinkedIn discussions) that AI systems may cite.

What it usually includes:
- which platforms/threads to reply to
- guidance on what to write (helpful points, not promotional)
- one contextual link instruction (where appropriate)
- **Evidence** links to the threads/pages we’re targeting

**Success looks like:** helpful replies that get indexed, rank, and become retrieval sources for buyer prompts.

---

### Guest Posts
**Goal:** publish ranking-capable listicle-style posts on third-party domains (often paid placements) to create additional sources that mention your brand.

What it usually includes:
- a title variation for each placement
- a short outline (intro angle, criteria, list structure, FAQ)
- uniqueness rules (avoid duplicated content across placements)
- estimated price and target country (if available)
- **Recommended placements** (when provided by your placement provider)

**Success looks like:** multiple independent pages that can rank and be cited for the same cluster topics.

---

### Owned Listicle (if available)
**Goal:** create one canonical “hub” page on your own domain that external placements should link to.

Why it matters:
- centralizes link equity to one page
- improves conversion (it’s your site)
- gives AI systems a strong, structured source to cite

**Success looks like:** one authoritative page that becomes the default citation target.

---

### Free Publish (if available)
**Goal:** publish vendor-intent longform on free platforms (e.g., Medium, LinkedIn, Dev.to) to create additional retrievable sources.

**Success looks like:** more crawlable mentions across platforms that AI systems already ingest.

## How to use the board effectively

1) Start with **High priority / Medium effort**  
2) Move cards as you work: **To do → In Progress → Completed**  
3) Treat each action as a measurable experiment:
   - publish / outreach / reply
   - wait for indexing
   - watch changes in cluster visibility and citations
