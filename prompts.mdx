title: Prompts
description: Create clusters and prompts, track visibility and position, and manage active, suggested, and inactive prompts across countries and AI platforms.
---

The Prompts section is where you define what Nobori.ai measures.

You manage two things:

- **Clusters** — your core offerings (topics)
- **Prompts** — buyer-style questions AI users ask

This page is also where you monitor **Visibility** and **Position** for each cluster and prompt.

---

## Filters

Use the top-right filters to scope results.

| Filter | What it changes |
|---|---|
| **All countries** | Filters results to specific prompt countries. |
| **All platforms** | Limits results to selected AI platforms. |
| **Time range** | Controls the reporting window (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, last 3 months). |

<Note>
Filters apply to cluster rollups and prompt-level metrics.

## Concepts

### Cluster

A **cluster** is your brand’s core service or product expressed as a main keyword.  
It groups related buyer prompts around the same commercial offering.

Clusters let you track performance at a topic level instead of only prompt-by-prompt.

### Prompt

A **prompt** is a real user question you want to monitor across AI platforms.  
Prompts are executed on a schedule and produce visibility data over time.

---

## Cluster list

The left panel lists:

- **All Clusters** — combined view across every cluster
- Individual clusters — topic-specific views

Each cluster shows roll-up metrics based on the prompts inside it:

- **Visibility** — percentage of prompts where your brand appears
- **Position** — average ranking position when your brand appears (lower is better)

---

## Prompt tabs

Prompts are organized into three states:

### Active

Active prompts are included in scheduled runs.

Each prompt row includes:

- **Prompt** — the tracked question
- **Position** — average ranking position for your brand
- **Visibility** — percentage of runs where your brand appears
- **Country** — where the prompt is executed from
- **Created** — when the prompt was added

### Suggested

Suggested prompts are recommendations generated from your current setup.

You can:

- **Activate** to start tracking
- **Reject** to remove irrelevant prompts

### Inactive

Inactive prompts are excluded from scheduled runs.

Use Inactive to:

- pause prompts without losing context
- keep your list clean while retaining historical performance

If you **delete** a prompt, its stored data is removed.

## Add a cluster

Use **Add Cluster** to create a topic grouping.

You’ll provide:

- **Name** (up to 60 characters)
- **Country** (where prompts in this cluster will run from)

---

## Add a prompt

Use **Add Prompt** to create a tracked buyer query.

You’ll provide:

- **Prompt text** (up to 200 characters)
- **Country** (where the prompt runs from)
- **Cluster** (optional)
  - If a cluster is selected, the prompt is assigned to it
  - If you’re in the All Clusters view, prompts may be added to **No Cluster**

Tags are shown as **coming soon**.

---

## Bulk actions

You can update multiple prompts at once.

Select prompts using the checkboxes, then use the bulk action bar to:

- **Assign Cluster** — move selected prompts into a cluster
- **Deactivate** — stop running selected prompts (moves them to Inactive)

<Note>
Bulk actions affect only the selected prompts.
</Note>

---

## Search and export

Use:

- **Search** to find specific prompts
- **Export** to download prompt-level data for reporting or analysis

---

## Boosting prompts

Clusters and prompts can be boosted to generate action tasks.

Depending on your state, you may see:

- **Boost Prompts** — generate new tasks
- **View Tasks** — open tasks already generated
- **Regenerate** — rerun boosting for updated tasks
