description: Inspect a single prompt’s visibility over time, compare competitors, review every AI response (executions), and see which sources were cited.

# Prompt Details

Prompt Details is the audit trail for a single prompt.  
Use it to answer four questions:

- Is the prompt trending up or down in **Visibility Score**?
- When the prompt triggers, what is our **Position** versus competitors?
- What did each platform actually answer in each run (**Executions**)?
- Which sources were used to produce those answers (**Citations**)?

---

## Filters and controls

At the top of the page, you can adjust the scope of what you’re reviewing.

| Control | What it affects |
|---|---|
| **Time range** | Changes the window for the chart, competitor rollup, executions, and citations. |
| **All platforms** | Filters results to a subset of AI platforms. |
| **Country** | Shows the country the prompt runs from (fixed per prompt). |
| **Status** | Marks the prompt as Active/Inactive (Active prompts are scheduled). |

## Visibility Score chart

The Visibility Score chart shows how often your brand appears for this prompt within the selected time range.

- **Visibility Score** = percentage of prompt runs where your brand is present in the AI answer.
- Use the **Competitors** toggle to overlay competitor lines on the chart for the same prompt.

<Note>
If you’re debugging why results changed, start here. The chart tells you *when* visibility shifted; executions and citations tell you *why*.

## Competitors table

The Competitors panel summarizes how brands performed for this prompt.

Columns:

- **Position** — average rank/placement for each brand when it appears (lower is better)
- **Visibility** — percentage of runs where the brand appears for this prompt

This table is the quickest way to see whether you’re losing because:
- you appear less often (Visibility problem), or
- you appear lower than others (Position problem)

## Executions

Executions is a run-by-run list of AI answers for this prompt.

Each row represents one execution (one platform, one country, one date).

Columns:

- **Execution date** — when the run happened
- **Response** — preview of the AI answer
- **Position** — your brand’s position in the answer (when detected)
- **Mentions** — brands detected in the answer (icons), with a count of total brands found
- **Mentioned** — whether your brand was mentioned (**Yes/No**)

Use the table to spot patterns like:
- a platform returning **No response**
- a platform consistently placing competitors above you
- runs where your brand is missing even though citations exist

### Execution Details

Click an execution row to open **Execution Details**.

Execution Details shows the full user-facing answer exactly as captured for that run, along with:

- **Status** (e.g., Succeeded)
- **Platform**
- **Country**

This is the source of truth when you need to verify what the model actually returned.

## Citations

Citations shows the sources AI platforms relied on to answer this prompt.

Each row is a cited URL with aggregated usage in the selected time range.

Columns:

- **URL** — the referenced page
- **Used** — how many times the URL appeared as a source for this prompt
- **Platforms** — which AI platforms cited it
- **Type** — classification of the source (e.g., Publisher)
- **Mentions** — brands detected in answers that cited this URL
- **Mentioned** — whether your brand was mentioned in those answers (**Yes/No**)

Why this matters:

- If reputable publishers are cited and you’re not mentioned, you likely have a **content / positioning gap**.
- If competitor-owned pages dominate citations, you likely have a **coverage gap** (your content isn’t the default reference).
- If your own domain is cited but your brand isn’t mentioned, you may have a **credit gap** (your content is useful, but your brand identity isn’t reinforced in the page).
