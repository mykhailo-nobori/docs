# 👋 Welcome to Nobori.ai

**Nobori.ai** helps you see how your brand appears inside today’s AI platforms — not just Google.  
We track **mentions**, **citations**, **sentiment**, and build your **AI Visibility Index** so you can measure and improve your presence in generative search.

## ⚡ Why It Matters

People no longer “search” — they **ask AI**.  
If your brand isn’t visible in those answers, you’re invisible to a growing part of your audience.

> Traditional SEO tracks clicks.  
> **Nobori.ai tracks visibility.**

We show:
- When your brand is mentioned or cited  
- What sentiment models express toward you  
- How you compare to competitors across models and markets
