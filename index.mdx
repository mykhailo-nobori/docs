# 👋 Welcome to Nobori.ai

### The AI Visibility Analytics Platform  
Nobori.ai helps you understand how your brand appears inside **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Perplexity**, and **Google AI Overviews** — measuring **Mentions**, **Citations**, **Sentiment**, and your overall **Visibility Index**.

---

## 🌍 Why AI Visibility Matters

Your audience no longer searches with keywords — they **ask AI**.  
People now rely on ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude for recommendations, research, and buying decisions. These models *choose* which brands to mention and trust.

> Traditional SEO tracks clicks.  
> **AI Visibility tracks presence.**

**Nobori.ai** shows:  
- *How often your brand appears or is cited by AI models*  
- *What sentiment those models express toward you*  
- *How your visibility compares across competitors, queries, and markets*

If you’re not visible inside AI answers, you’re invisible in the next generation of search.

## 🧠 How Nobori.ai Collects Data

Nobori.ai uses **Hybrid Query Analysis** — a reproducible, compliant method that mirrors real user behavior.

- **Authentic results** — We run the same queries real users ask AI models.  
- **Cross-model benchmarking** — Consistent measurement across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity.  
- **Transparent methodology** — Every query is logged, reproducible, and auditable.  

This ensures visibility data matches **real-world AI responses**, not filtered API outputs.
