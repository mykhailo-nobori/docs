## What Nobori.ai Shows
- **Mentions** — when your brand is named in AI responses  
- **Citations** — when your pages or domains are used as sources  
- **Visibility Score** — percentage of tracked prompts where your brand appears

## Why It Matters
Users increasingly ask AI systems for recommendations and comparisons.  
If your brand isn’t visible in those answers, you’re invisible to that demand. Nobori.ai makes this visibility measurable and actionable.

## How It Works
- **Prompts** — real questions your audience asks AI tools  
- **Daily Runs** — scheduled checks across supported models and markets  
- **Dashboards & Reports** — visibility over time, competitor comparisons, and source analysis

## What To Do Next
1. **Add your brand** — name and domain  
2. **Select competitors and markets**  
3. **Create or accept suggested prompts**  
4. **Open the dashboard** — review mentions, citations, and your Visibility Score
