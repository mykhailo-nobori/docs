description: Measure how your brand appears across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — track mentions, citations, and visibility over time.

**Nobori.ai** shows how your brand appears inside AI platforms — not just Google.  
We track **mentions**, **citations**, and a combined **AI Visibility Score** so you can measure and improve presence in generative search.

## Why It Matters

People don’t “search” — they ask AI.  
If your brand isn’t visible in those answers, you’re invisible to a growing share of demand.

> Traditional SEO tracks clicks. Nobori.ai tracks visibility.

We show:
- when your brand is **mentioned** or **cited**;
- which models and markets you show up in;
- how you compare against competitors.

## What You Can Do

- See your brand across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and AI Overviews
