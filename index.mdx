## Why AI Visibility Matters

Search is no longer just about keywords.  
Your customers are now asking **ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, or Claude** for recommendations, comparisons, and buying decisions — and these models decide *which brands appear*.

Traditional SEO only measures web traffic.  
**AI Visibility** measures something deeper:  
→ *How often your brand is mentioned or cited by AI models*  
→ *What sentiment those models express toward you*  
→ *How your presence compares to competitors across markets and time*

If your brand doesn’t appear in AI answers, it effectively doesn’t exist in this new discovery layer.

## What Nobori.ai Does

Nobori.ai reveals your brand’s footprint inside AI ecosystems.

We track how generative-AI models reference your brand, your content, and your competitors — across real conversations and user queries.

**Visibility happens through four dimensions:**

- **Mentions** — When your brand is named inside AI responses.  
- **Citations** — When your site or content is referenced as a trusted source.  
- **Sentiment** — How AI models *feel* about your brand (positive, neutral, or negative).  
- **Visibility Index** — A combined metric showing your overall AI presence and ranking potential.

This data helps you understand *where*, *how often*, and *in what context* you appear across the most influential AI platforms.

## How Nobori.ai Collects Data

Nobori.ai uses a **Hybrid Query Analysis** approach — blending **compliant user-simulation** and **structured query benchmarking** to collect authentic visibility data.

We simulate the same user prompts real people type into AI tools, capturing exactly what the models respond with.  
This method ensures:

- **Real-world accuracy** — We measure the same answers end-users see, not sanitized API outputs.  
- **Cross-model comparability** — Consistent data from ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and others.  
- **Repeatable benchmarks** — Each query run can be reproduced, verified, and compared over time.

Unlike legacy scraping tools, Nobori.ai’s approach is fully transparent, audited, and built for long-term scalability.
