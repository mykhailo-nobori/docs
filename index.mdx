## What Nobori.ai Shows

- **Mentions** — when your brand is named in AI responses
- **Citations** — when your pages or domains are used as sources
- **Visibility Score** — percentage of tracked prompts where your brand appears
- **Position** —  average ranking of your brand in AI responses

## Why It Matters

Users increasingly ask AI systems for recommendations and comparisons.\
If your brand isn’t visible in those answers, you’re invisible to that demand. Nobori.ai makes this visibility measurable and actionable.

## How It Works

- **Prompts** — real questions your audience asks AI tools
- **Daily Runs** — scheduled checks across supported models and markets
- **Dashboards & Reports** — visibility over time, competitor comparisons, and source analysis

3. **Create or accept suggested clusters and prompts**
4. **Open the dashboard** — review mentions, citations, and your Visibility Score
2. **Add your competitors**
