title: Competitors
description: Add, manage, and benchmark competitors across AI platforms. Compare visibility, position, and mentions to understand your competitive landscape in generative search.
---

The **Competitors** section lets you benchmark your brand against others that appear in AI-generated answers.

Nobori.ai identifies which brands are mentioned alongside yours across AI platforms — and tracks their relative visibility and ranking over time.

---

## Overview

The page is divided into two main tabs:

- **Active** — competitors currently tracked in your workspace  
- **Suggested** — AI-identified brands frequently mentioned alongside yours  

You can manually add competitors or activate them from suggestions.

---

## Active Competitors

Active competitors are included in your visibility benchmarking.

For each competitor, you’ll see:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| **Position** | Average ranking position in AI answers |
| **Visibility** | % of prompts where the competitor appears |
| **Sentiment** | (Coming soon) Tone of mentions across AI responses |

### Position

Position reflects how prominently a competitor appears in AI answers.

Lower numbers mean stronger presence:

- `#1.3` → Frequently appears near the top  
- `#2.9` → Appears lower in responses  

This helps you understand not just *who appears*, but *who dominates*.

### Visibility

Visibility is the percentage of tracked prompts where the competitor is mentioned.

Example:

- `92%` → Appears in 92% of tracked prompts  
- `63%` → Appears in 63% of tracked prompts  

Use this to evaluate share of AI exposure across your tracked queries.

## Adding Competitors

You can add competitors in two ways:

### 1. Manual Add

Click **Add Competitor** and enter:

- **Name** — brand name as it appears in AI answers  
- **Website** — main domain (used for citation detection)

Manual addition is useful for:

- Known direct competitors  
- Emerging brands not yet detected by AI  
- Strategic benchmarking targets  

---

### 2. Suggested Competitors

The **Suggested** tab lists brands frequently mentioned alongside yours.

For each suggested competitor, you’ll see:

- **Mentions** — number of times they appeared across tracked prompts  
- **Action** — Activate or Reject  

Activate to begin tracking them in the Active tab.

Reject if irrelevant.

This list updates dynamically based on AI response analysis.

---

## Bulk Actions

You can select multiple competitors and:

- **Activate**
- **Reject**
- **Delete** (for Active competitors)

This helps maintain a clean, relevant competitive set.

---

## Why This Matters

AI models don’t show ten blue links — they synthesize and select.

Understanding who appears alongside your brand reveals:

- Which competitors dominate AI answers  
- Where you are losing visibility  
- Which brands AI systems consistently prefer  

Tracking competitors is foundational to improving your AI visibility strategy.
