title: Citations
description: See which pages and domains AI platforms rely on to answer your prompts. Identify trusted sources, competitor-owned citations, and publisher targets for outreach.

# Citations

Citations shows the sources AI platforms relied on when answering your tracked prompts.

This view is designed for two jobs:
- **Understand what AI trusts** in your category (the sources it repeatedly pulls from).
- **Turn citation patterns into action** (what to improve on your site, and which publishers to target).

## Filters

Use the filters in the top bar to scope the dataset you’re reviewing.

| Filter | What it does |
|---|---|
| **All platforms** | Limit citations to selected AI platforms. |
| **Time range** | Review citation trends for a specific period (e.g., last 7/30/90 days). |

## Two views: Cited Pages vs Cited Domains

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cited Pages" icon="link">
    Cited Pages lists individual URLs that AI platforms used as sources.

    Use this view when you want to:
    - find specific articles that dominate citations for your prompts
    - see whether those pages lead to **Mentions** of your brand
    - identify publisher pages where you’re missing (good outreach targets)

    **Columns**

    | Column | Meaning |
    |---|---|
    | **URL** | The cited page. |
    | **Used** | How many times this URL appeared as a source across tracked prompt executions in the selected time range. |
    | **Platforms** | Which AI platforms cited this page. |
    | **Type** | Source category (Publisher, Competitor, Owned, Community, Other). |
    | **Mentions** | Brands detected in the answers that cited this page. |
    | **Mentioned** | Whether your brand was mentioned (**Yes/No**) in answers that cited this page. |

    <Note>
      **Mentions** and **Citations** are different signals. A model can cite a source without mentioning your brand, and it can mention your brand without citing your domain.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cited Domains" icon="globe">
    Cited Domains aggregates citations by domain instead of individual URLs.

    Use this view when you want to:
    - see which domains AI platforms rely on most (category authority)
    - identify systematic gaps (competitor domains cited more than yours)
    - prioritize outreach targets (publishers that appear across many prompts)

    **Columns**

    | Column | Meaning |
    |---|---|
    | **Domain** | The cited domain (e.g., github.com, reddit.com). |
    | **Used** | How often this domain appeared as a source across tracked prompt executions (shown as a percentage in this view). |

    <Note>
      Cited Domains is a prioritization tool. Once you find a high-usage domain, switch back to **Cited Pages** to see which exact URLs are driving it.

## Source types

The **Type** column helps you decide what to do next.

| Type | What it usually means | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| **Publisher** | Independent editorial sites / review sites drive the answer space. | Strong outreach targets; improve coverage where you’re missing. |
| **Competitor** | Competitor pages are used as sources. | You likely have a content gap; build/refresh competing pages and comparisons. |
| **Owned** | Your own domain is being used. | Good sign; ensure pages clearly reinforce your brand and positioning. |
| **Community** | Forums, community posts, Q&A. | Participate or seed accurate references; consider community strategy. |
| **Other** | Uncategorized sources (e.g., Wikipedia, docs sites, misc). | Validate whether it’s worth influencing; sometimes it’s non-actionable. |

## Search and export

Use **Search** to find a domain or URL quickly.  
Use **Export** to download the current table view for analysis or reporting.

## How to use Citations in practice

1. **Sort by Used** to find the sources that actually shape answers.
2. Check **Mentioned = No** on publisher pages — those are common “citation-without-credit” gaps.
3. If competitors dominate citations, treat it as a coverage race: comparison pages, category pages, and “alternatives” content usually moves the needle.
4. Use domains as a shortlist; use pages to pick exact outreach targets.
