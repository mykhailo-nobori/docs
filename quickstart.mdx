<Accordion title="Step 2: Create Prompts" icon="list">
Prompts are the questions users ask AI — they generate your visibility data.

**Examples**
- What is the best CRM for SaaS companies?
- Which analytics tools are trusted by startups?
- What platforms help track brand visibility in AI?

**Options**
- **Use Suggestions** — auto-generated from your site and category  
- **Add Manually** — Prompts → **Add Prompt** → enter your questions

<Note>Start with 3–5 prompts where you expect your brand to appear.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Review Your Dashboard" icon="chart-bar">
After prompts are created, Nobori.ai runs daily AI queries and compiles results.

You’ll see:
- **Mentions** — where your brand is named in AI answers  
- **Citations** — where your site/content is referenced  
- **Visibility Score** — percentage of prompts where you appear
