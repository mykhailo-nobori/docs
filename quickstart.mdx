description: "Get your first AI visibility data in minutes — onboard, review prompt runs, and generate actions to get cited."

Nobori.ai helps you measure and improve how your brand shows up in AI answers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and more) — based on **real prompt runs** and the **sources** models cite.

This guide shows the typical workflow:
**Onboard → Track → Measure → Act**.

---

## 2-minute overview

1) **Complete onboarding**  
Add your **Brand**, **Website**, **Primary country**, and **Current focus** → accept or edit suggested **clusters** and **prompts**.

2) **Wait for your first runs**  
Open **Dashboard** and wait until your first prompt executions finish.

3) **Add competitors**  
Add a few competitors so you can benchmark visibility and position.

4) **Review prompt results**  
Go to **Prompts** → open **Prompt Details** → review **Executions** and **Citations**.

5) **Boost the clusters you care about**  
In **Prompts**, click **Boost** for a cluster to generate actionable tasks.

6) **Execute tasks in Get Cited**  
Work through **Cluster Actions** (outreach/community/placements) and **Foundation** (site baseline audit).

<Note>
If you want the fastest “aha moment”: complete onboarding → open Dashboard → open any Prompt Details → check which sources were cited.

## Step-by-step

<div className="tight-accordions">
  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Step 1: Complete onboarding (brand → clusters → prompts)" icon="sparkles">
      During onboarding you set the tracking baseline:

      <b>You provide</b>
      - <b>Brand</b> — the name we look for in AI answers
      - <b>Website</b> — used to detect when your pages are cited
      - <b>Primary country</b> — where prompts run from by default
      - <b>Current focus</b> — extra context that improves suggested clusters and prompts

      <b>Then you confirm your tracking scope</b>
      - <b>Clusters</b> — the commercial topics you want to win (e.g., “Custom Software Development”)
      - <b>Prompts</b> — buyer questions inside each cluster (the inputs we run)

      <Note>
        Clusters and prompts can be edited later in <a href="/prompts">Prompts</a>.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 2: Open Dashboard and wait for first runs" icon="chart-bar">
      After onboarding, you land on <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>.

      Your first prompt runs may take a bit — once they complete, you’ll start seeing:
      - <b>Visibility Score</b> — % of prompts where your brand appears in AI-generated answers
      - <b>Competitors table</b> — rank + visibility (once competitors are added)
      - <b>Cited Domains</b> — domains AI relied on to answer your prompts

      Tip: use the top filters (<b>Platforms</b>, <b>Time range</b>, <b>Country</b>) to narrow what you’re viewing.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 3: Add competitors (benchmark your category)" icon="users">
      Go to <a href="/competitors">Competitors</a> and add a few brands buyers compare you with.

      Competitors unlock:
      - visibility benchmarking (who appears more often)
      - average position comparisons
      - faster prioritization (which clusters/prompt types you’re losing)

      <Note>
        You’ll also see competitor lines/toggles in places like Dashboard and Prompt Details.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 4: Review Prompt Details (Executions + Citations)" icon="file-search">
      Go to <a href="/prompts">Prompts</a> to manage clusters and analyze performance.

      <b>What you’ll see</b>
      - Tabs: <b>Active</b>, <b>Suggested</b>, <b>Inactive</b>
      - Cluster-level <b>Visibility</b> and <b>Position</b> (based on prompts inside the cluster)
      - Prompt table columns: <b>Position</b>, <b>Visibility</b>, <b>Country</b>, <b>Created</b>

      Click any prompt to open <b>Prompt Details</b>:
      - <b>Visibility chart</b> (with competitor toggle)
      - <b>Executions</b> — full AI responses per run (status, platform, and whether you were mentioned)
      - <b>Citations</b> — pages/domains used as sources (what AI relied on)

      This is where you validate:<br />
      <b>Do models mention you? And which sources are shaping the answers?</b>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 5: Boost clusters to generate actions" icon="bolt">
      Boost is how you turn tracking data into a concrete plan.

      From <a href="/prompts">Prompts</a>, choose a cluster and click <b>Boost</b>.
      We analyze what AI systems cite for your selected buyer-intent prompts and generate tasks to increase your chance of being:
      - <b>mentioned</b> in answers
      - <b>cited</b> via trusted third-party sources

      Boost is most useful on prompts that look like:
      - “Best [category] tools / vendors”
      - “Shortlist providers for [use case]”
      - “Compare options for [requirements]”
      - “Which solution should we choose for [scenario]”
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 6: Execute tasks in Cluster Actions + Foundation" icon="bolt">
      Nobori.ai gives you two action areas in <b>Get Cited</b>:

      <b>1) Foundation</b> (<a href="/foundation">GEO Audit</a>)<br />
      Baseline checks that affect whether AI systems can crawl and trust your site.
      - Robots.txt, sitemap, crawlability checks
      - If something blocks retrieval, we create tasks to fix it

      <b>2) Cluster Actions</b> (<a href="/cluster-actions">Boost actions</a>)<br />
      A board of tasks based on what AI cites today for your boosted prompts.
      - Outreach (get added to existing listicles/directories)
      - Community (helpful replies on threads that can rank)
      - Guest posts / placements (when provided by your placements workflow)

      Use the board columns to track progress:<br />
      <b>To do → In Progress → Completed</b> (or <b>Dismissed</b> if not relevant).
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</div>

## What to do first

If you’re not sure where to start, do this order:

1) Pick <b>one cluster</b> you care about most  
2) Open <b>Prompt Details</b> for its top prompts  
3) Go back to <b>Prompts</b> and <b>Boost</b> that cluster  
4) Work tasks from <b>High priority / Medium effort</b> first  
5) Re-check Dashboard and Citations after new pages get indexed
